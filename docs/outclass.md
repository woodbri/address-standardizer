# OutClass Types

The goal of the address standardizer is to parse an input address string into token, then match those tokens to a grammar and based on that matching reclassify or assign the tokens to the OutClass Type fields. You can think of the this as a table with the column names as the OutClass Types.

For example lets look at the following address ``123 MAIN ST ANYTOWN MA 12345 USA``:

| Step |  A  |  B   |  C   |  D   |  E   |  F   |  G   |
| ---- | --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Tokens | 123 | MAIN | ST | ANYTOWN | MA | 12345 | USA |
| InClass | NUMBER | WORD | TYPE,WORD | WORD | PROV | NUMBER,QUINT | NATION |
| OutClass | HOUSE | STREET | SUFTYP | CITY | PROV | POSTAL | NATION |

Here we parse the address into Tokens in line 1, and they get classified by the type of Token it is as seen in the second line, and after we match the tokens against a grammar and reclassify them we get the OutClass classifications on line three.

The full list of OutClass types is listed in the following table.
